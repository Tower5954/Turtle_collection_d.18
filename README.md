Turtle Collection

Part of the winter collection for Python Turtle. This one will build a shape within the number set I.E. build a 3 angled shape then 4 and so on and so forth.
Changes colours randomly from a list and it also has a "hero" name that you wont find out because there isnt a function to do that yet
